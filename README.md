| <a href="https://github.com/sl2902/practicum/tree/main/sprint01_bank_loan_report">Sprint1</a>       |Prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. You’ll need to find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children have an impact on whether they           will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness. Your report will be considered when building a credit score for a           potential customer. A credit score is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.|
| <a href="https://github.com/sl2902/practicum/tree/main/sprint02_car_sales_ads">Sprint2</a>        |You're an analyst at Crankshaft List. Hundreds of free advertisements for vehicles are published on your site every day. You need to study data collected           over the last few years and determine which factors influence the price of a vehicle.|
| <a href="https://github.com/sl2902/practicum/tree/main/sprint03_telecom_prepaid_plans">Sprint3</a>        |You work as an analyst for the telecom operator Megaline. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department             wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget. You are going to carry out a preliminary analysis of             the plans based on a relatively small client selection. You'll have the data on 500 Megaline clients: who the clients are, where they're from, which plan           they use, and the number of calls they made and text messages they sent in 2018. Your job is to analyze clients' behavior and determine which prepaid plan           brings in more revenue.|
| <a href="https://github.com/sl2902/practicum/tree/main/sprint04_online_video_games">Sprint4</a>        |You work for the online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and           historical data on game sales are available from open sources. You need to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will               allow you to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns. In front of you is data going back to 2016. Let’s imagine that it’s December 2016           and you’re planning a campaign for 2017. (The important thing is to get experience working with data. It doesn't really matter whether you're forecasting           2017 sales based on data from 2016 or 2017 sales based on data from 2016.) The dataset contains the abbreviation ESRB. The Entertainment Software Rating             Board evaluates a game's content and assigns an age rating such as Teen or Mature.|
| <a href="https://github.com/sl2902/practicum/tree/main/sprint05_zuber_ride_sharing">Sprint5</a>        |You're working as an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago. Your task is to find patterns in the available                       information. You want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. Working with a database, you'll analyze data from             competitors and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency.|
| <a href="https://github.com/sl2902/practicum/tree/main/sprint06_teleco_megaline_classification">Sprint6</a>        |Mobile carrier Megaline has found out that many of their subscribers use legacy plans. They want to develop a model that would analyze subscribers'                 behavior and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra. You have access to behavior data about subscribers who have already switched to the           new plans (from the project for the Statistical Data Analysis course). For this classification task, you need to develop a model that will pick the right           plan. Since you’ve already performed the data preprocessing step, you can move straight to creating the model. Develop a model with the highest possible             accuracy. In this project, the threshold for accuracy is 0.75. Check the accuracy using the test dataset.|
| <a href="https://github.com/sl2902/practicum/tree/main/sprint07_best_bank_customer_churn">Sprint7</a>        |Beta Bank customers are leaving: little by little, chipping away every month. The bankers figured out it’s cheaper to save the existing customers rather             than to attract new ones. We need to predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon. You have the data on clients’ past behavior and termination of             contracts with the bank. Build a model with the maximum possible F1 score. To pass the project, you need an F1 score of at least 0.59. Check the F1 for             the test set. Additionally, measure the AUC-ROC metric and compare it with the F1.|
| <a href="https://github.com/sl2902/practicum/tree/main/sprint08_oilygiant_oil_wells">Sprint8</a>        |You work for the OilyGiant mining company. Your task is to find the best place for a new well. Steps to choose the location: 1) Collect the oil well                 parameters in the selected region: oil quality and volume of reserves. 2) Build a model for predicting the volume of reserves in the new wells; 3) Pick             the oil wells with the highest estimated values. 4) Pick the region with the highest total profit for the selected oil wells. You have data on oil samples from three regions. Parameters of each oil well in the region are already known. Build a model that will help to pick the region with the highest profit margin. Analyze potential profit and risks using the Bootstrapping technique.|
| <a href="https://github.com/sl2902/practicum/tree/main/sprint09_gold_recovery">Sprint9</a>        |Prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for Zyfra. The company develops efficiency solutions for heavy industry. The model should predict the               amount of gold recovered from gold ore. You have the data on extraction and purification. The model will help to optimize the production and eliminate               unprofitable parameters. You need to: 1) Prepare the data; 2) Perform data analysis; 3) Develop and train a model.|
|  <a href="https://github.com/sl2902/practicum/tree/main/sprint10_sure_tomorrow_insurance">Sprint10        |The Sure Tomorrow insurance company wants to solve several tasks with the help of Machine Learning, and you are asked to evaluate that possibility. 1)              Task 1: Find customers who are similar to a given customer. This will help the company's agents with marketing. 2) Task 2: Predict whether a new customer            is likely to receive an insurance benefit. Can a prediction model do better than a dummy model? 3) Task 3: Predict the number of insurance benefits a new            customer is likely to receive using a linear regression model. 4) Task 4: Protect clients' personal data without breaking the model from the previous                task.|
| <a href="https://github.com/sl2902/practicum/tree/main/sprint11_rusty_bargain_car_prices">Sprint11</a>        |Rusty Bargain used car sales service is developing an app                                                                                                            to attract new customers.
